Some ideas of things I want to implement:

BACKUPS:

-   Downloading backups
-   Restoring backups
-   Nightly backups
-   Backup to Google Drive
-   Download current state of the wiki without having to backup it first

FUNCTIONALITY:

-   Modify `users.csv`
-   View the (filterable) list of tiddlers in a given wiki
-   Copy a tiddler to different wikis
